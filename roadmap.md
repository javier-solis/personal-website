# Roadmap

## Foreword
In the descriptions below, "fast" refers to minimizing front-end file sizes (which in turn reduces user network usage) and client-side computations & dynamic movements (which in turn reduces user RAM/CPU usage).

## Versions

### v1
#### Front-End
A minimalist and fast webpage to showcase my past and ongoing software-related activities. The last update to this version can be viewed [here](https://javier-solis.me).
#### Back-End
Leveraging Github Pages to redirect all `front-end` contents to a purchased domain name. My domain name was obtained from [namecheap.com](https://namecheap.com).
#### Timeline
* Started: 2021
* Finished: August 2022 (Projected)

### v2
(Description is a WIP)

### v3
